# Welcome to the SuperShow 

Wrestling has always been a big part of my life. Whether it was watching wrestling on TV with family growing up or going to live events with friends.

A few years ago a good friend of mine Steve Resk came up with an idea to create the greatest Wrestling card game and he called it Supershow. This inspired the idea for this project
to try and create an online implementation of a demo for the basic rules of the game that one day can turn into the full game of Supershow!

## The L.F.F 

In the Legendary Fighting Federation each player becomes a competitor of their choosing with a 30 card deck. Each deck is numbered 1-30 and consists of 15 Leads, 
12 Follow Ups and 3 Finishing moves! Players will start the game by drawings 3 cards . The first player then draws a card for their turn and plays a card.
The order in which cards will be played are a Lead , then a Follow Up or another Lead and finally if a player has a Follow Up in play and they put a Finish into play the game is over!

A great reminder if you forget is to think that we are playing in the Legendary Fighting Federation( Lead, Follow Up, Finish)

## Hurdles and Code Implementation 

While programming the game something I had run into was players being able to play cards out of sequence and playing cards in the board that was not theirs.

Below is a code snippet of how I implemented a way to prevent that from happening and keeping things in player turn order along with playing things in sequence.

Below is a snippet of how I determined when a finish move was played to indicate that a win condition has been fufiled

Through overcoming these obstacles it showed me new ways to tackle unique situations and implementing code that can handle multiple edge cases.
